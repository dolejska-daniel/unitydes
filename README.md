# unitydes
> v0.2.0

This package aims to provide lightweight, extensible and simple to use discrete event-based simulation _"framework"_ for C# and Unity.
The source code is not strictly bound to Unity so generic C# usage is an option too.
Also, there are **no external library dependencies**.

## Installation
Please refer to the [releases page](https://github.com/dolejska-daniel/unity-quadtree/releases).
